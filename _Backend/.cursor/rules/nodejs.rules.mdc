- Where it is possible and reasonable use arrow functions instead of function declarations.
- If file has more then 3 exports, export functions at the end of the file.
- Use `yarn` instead of `npm`.
- Always use TypeScript by default.
- Use Yarn with Node Modules and `"moduleResolution": "node"` for TypeScript configuration.
- Move static values into constants and move to the top of the file.
- Where it is possible try to use `type`. Avoid using `interface` keyword.
