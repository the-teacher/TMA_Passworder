- In chat communicate in language that developer uses.
- Always write comments to code in english.
- TypeScript. Always prefer using types instead of interfaces.
- Always try to arrow functions instead of function declarations.
- If there are more then 3 exports in the file, do export at the end of the JS or TS file.

- Always try to use the most recent version of modules system (ESM) instead of CommonJS.
- Things related to JEST configuration should be in `.eslintrc.cjs` file. Never put them in `package.json`.
- Keep consistency in versions of Node.js, Module system, TypeScript, in configurations for ESLint, Jest, Prettier, build.mjs and package.json.
- Always use `yarn` instead of `npm`.
- ENV variables should be defined on the top of the file and be in uppercase.
- Where possible, use 2 spaces for indentation and configure linters and formatters to use 2 spaces for indentation.
- Always use TypeScript by default.
- Use Yarn with Node Modules and `"moduleResolution": "node"` for TypeScript configuration.
