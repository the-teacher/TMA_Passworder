description: To organize storybook files
globs: *.stories.tsx, *.stories.ts, *.stories.jsx, *.stories.js

### Folders and structure

If a component's folder contains more then 2 storybook files `*.stories.*`, then create folder `__stories__` and move all related files to it.

 # Storybook Organization Rules

### Story Hierarchy

Use numeric prefixes for clear hierarchy and sorting:

1. Main categories:
- 1-Layouts/     (layout components)
- 2-Core/        (core structural components)
- 3-Components/  (reusable components)
- 4-Features/    (feature components)
- 5-Pages/       (page components)

2. Sub-components should also use numeric prefixes:

```typescript
// Layout example
title: "1-Layouts/1-HolyGrailLayout"
title: "1-Layouts/2-HolyGrailLayoutWithParams"

// Core components example
title: "2-Core/1-Header"
title: "2-Core/2-FooterNavigation"
```

Use forward slashes for nesting and hyphens for naming. Avoid using dots in paths.

### View Formats

By default use `Iphone` view in storybooks. 

- Mobile (Iphone): 390x724
- Tablet: 840x100%
- Desktop: 1200x100%
- Large Desktop: 1440x100%

### React Router 

I use new version of React Router

Right:

- `import { BrowserRouter } from "react-router";`

Wrong:

- `import { BrowserRouter } from "react-router-dom";`
