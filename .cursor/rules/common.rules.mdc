### Language for Comments

Always write comments to code in english.

### Module System

Always try to use the most recent version of modules system (ESM) instead of CommonJS.

### Function Style

Always try to arrow functions instead of function declarations.

### Export Style

If there are more then 5 exports in the file, do export at the end of the file.

### Jest Configuration

Things related to JEST configuration should be in `.eslintrc.cjs` file. Never put them in `package.json`.

### Version Consistency

Keep consistency in versions of Node.js, Module system, TypeScript, in configurations for ESLint, Jest, Prettier, build.mjs and package.json.

### TypeScript Types

TypeScript. Always prefer using types instead of interfaces.

### Package Manager

Always use `yarn` instead of `npm`.

### Environment Variables

ENV variables should be defined on the top of the file and be in uppercase.

### Code Indentation

Where possible, use 2 spaces for indentation and configure linters and formatters to use 2 spaces for indentation.

### TypeScript Usage

Always use TypeScript by default.

### Module Resolution

Use Yarn with Node Modules and `"moduleResolution": "node"` for TypeScript configuration.
